            <br />
            <br />
            ‘Please stay between the yellow lines,’ a holographic figure appeared and led the way. They were in smooth silver blue gowns, with matching face bubbles and protective contact lenses. Their silky blue outfits swayed as if they were floating. Their gentle voice echoes across the marble floor.
            <br />
            I followed the path, wedged between the yellow lines and zigzagged across the grand but empty hall. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The blue fairies hovered as I walked, maintaining a safe distance. Cautiously managed by their calm presence, it was an effective walk. They left no trace on the marble floor. No shadows, no memory.`

            Sitting in my bed I reached towards the beverage dispenser on the wall above my feet. Numbers glowed in blue as my fingers hovered over the black aluminum panel:  No-origin Caffe = 6; Nano H2O&gt; = 67; Multi-vitamins dissolvable = 24; Carbon-O = 119
            <br />
            <br />
            I persisted and followed my impulses. A ‘Ding’ came through my overhead speakers moments later, the black panel slide-opened, within the wall a canister of artificial coffee. It was warm to touch. I twisted open the lid. My senses awaken. 
            <br />
            <br />

            <br />
            Today’s daily affirmation showed a GIF of, again, me, in a buttery mustard silk gown standing at the top of a mountain, overlooking an ocean of tree tops against a blue sky. My arms were swaying front and back, front and back with a tiny editing glitch in-between. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I was smiling at me. ‘You are an abundance,’ the voice echoed in my EarPods, sending soothing energy through my spine to the back of my neck. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The image of a rainforest reminded me of birds. I’m trying to remember birdsongs but I couldn’t seem to, coming to the realisation that perhaps that memory had too, been erased due to incompatible optimisation.  
            <br />
            <br />
            The voice continued, ‘trust yourself, and you will be free,’ my arms were swaying front and back, front and back. The GIF dissolved into an electric blue.`

            I stepped into the green room, turned to find holographic blue fairies dissolved into tiny drones, the devices where they retracted into when the task completed. The hall behind me darkened into a deeper shade of grey.
            <br />
            ’You’ve arrived. A new journey awaits,’ a whisper came through the wall speakers. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Today was going to be the day I would finally remember, the day I no longer needed to be selective about my memories again. I sat on the chromatic stool in front of the door, waiting. Beethoven’s ‘String Quintet in C Major’ filled up the room with cheerful anticipation. Today I would be let out of Management.`
